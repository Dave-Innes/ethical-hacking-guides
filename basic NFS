nfs guide
BASIC NFS:
RUN THIS AS ROOT!

showmount -e <IP ADDRESS>

mkdir /tmp/nfs (you can name this file whatever)

mount  -o nolock -t nfs <IP ADDRESS>:/ (this will be the file you can access) /tmp/nfs (this will be whatever you called the file ) 

ssh-keygen (Dont enter a password)

cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> tmp/nfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys 

then just ssh into the machine.

to unmount the drive do  umount /tmp/nfs (or whatever you called it )
